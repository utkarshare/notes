							<p class="question"><h2>R1. What is the difference between a <b>host</b> and an <b>end system</b>. List several different types of end systems. Is the Web server an end system ?</h2></p>
							<p class="solution"> There is <strong>no difference between a host and an end systm</strong>. The terms may be (and are) used interchangeably. Any computer sustem that is the source or destination for information transfer can be called an end system - mobile phones, IoT enabled devices such as fridges, washing machines, garage doors, home security systems, PCs, laptops, game consoles etc - are all examples of hosts. A Web server is also a host (or an end system), as <b>it is the source of (or destination of) information transfer</b></p>

							<p class="solution">In HFC, there is a single coaxial cable to which all home users connect. All transmissions from the cable head-end are broadcast to every house on the cable.

					<p class="question"><h2>R11. Suppose there is exactly one packet switch between a sending host and a reciving host. The transmission rate between the sending host and the switch is \(R_{1}\). The trasmission rate between the switch and the reciving host is \(R_{2}\). The switch uses store-and-forward packet switching. If we ignore the queuing delay, processing delay and the propagation delay, then what is the end-to-end delay to send a packet of length \(L\)</h2></p>
					<p class="solution">The time taken for the packet to go from source host to switch is \(\frac{L}{R_{1}}\). The time taken for the packet to go from switch to reciving host is \(\frac{L}{R_{2}}\). Thus the total end-to-end delay is \[\frac{L}{R_{1}} + \frac{L}{R_{2}} = \frac{L\times(R_{1} + R_{2})}{R_{1} \times R_{2}}\]</p>

						</h2>
					</p>
					<p class="solution">
						<ol>
							<li>Only 2 users can be supported in circuit switching mode</li>
							<li>If fewer than 2 users are using the system, then the arrival rate of packets will not exceed 2Mbps, and since that is the transmission rate of the link, the packets will exit as soon as they enter, with no queuing delays. If 3 users or more are transmitting, the packet arrival rate will exceed 2Mbps, and thus queues will form, leading to queuing delays</li>
							<li>Probability that a given user is transmitting is already given, it is \(0.2\).</li>
							<li>Probability that all three users are transmitting at a given time is \((0.2)^{3} = 0.008\). Thus the fraction of time for which the queue is growing is \(0.0008\)</li>

					<p class="question"><h2>R14. Why will two ISPs at the same level peer with each other ? How do IXPs earn money ?</h2></p>
					<p class="solution">ISPs at the same level with peer with each other to save money. Since they pay higher tier ISPs according to the amount of data they transmit, by peering with other ISPs they can share data flow destined for each other, without having to go through the higher tier ISPs. Thus they reduce the amount of data and the the amount of payment to the higher tier ISPS. To facilitate these peerings, some companies make IXPs where many ISPs can peer together. Thus the ISPs pay the IXPs some amount of money, and in return they can peer with many other ISPs at once. The amount they pay to the IXPs is lower than the amount they would have had to pay to the higher tier ISPs for the volume of traffic that is now directed to the IXP</p>

					<p class="solution">Content providers also have to pay intermediate ISPs money proportional to the traffic they generate. In creating their own networks and linking those networks directly to access ISPs and IXPs, they can reach these IXPs directly and not have to pay the intermediary ISPs money for their traffic</p>

More generally, how long does it take a packet of length \(L\), to propoagate over a link of distance \(d\), propagation speed \(s\), and transmission rate \(R\) Mbps ? Does this delay depend upon packet length ? Does this delay depend upon transmission rate ?</h2></p>
					<p class="solution">The time taken by a packet of length \(1000\) bytes to propagate over a distance of \(2500\)km, propagation speed of \(2.5 \times 10^{8}\frac{meter}{second}\), and trasmission rate of \(2\)Mbps is \[\frac{2500 \times 10^{3} m}{2.5 \times 10^{8} m s^{-1}}\] \[ = \frac{25\ s}{2.5 \times 10^{3}}\] \[ = 10 \times 10^{-3} m\ s^{-1}\] \[ = 10 ms^{-1}\].
